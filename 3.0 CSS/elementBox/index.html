          The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest
          living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.
        </span>
        It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa
        camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to
        eight extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research
        into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological
        measurements of Giraffa. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric
        species known from fossils.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="important">
          The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely
          long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat
          patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its
          closest extant relative, the okapi.
        </span>
        Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in
        the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes
        usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves,
        fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they
        browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.
